***Game of Life in C# (using Raylib)***

This is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in C#, using the Raylib library for graphics. <br/>
The Game of Life is a cellular automaton where cells evolve based on the number of neighboring cells,<br/> creating complex patterns from simple rules.

<br/>

**Features**:<br/>
  Placing cells<br/>
  Pause/Resume simulation<br/>
  Generate Random cells<br/>



**How it works**: <br/>
  Each cell follows Conway's rules:<br/>
  Any live cell with fewer than 2 or more than 3 neighbors dies.<br/>
  Any live cell with 2 or 3 neighbors lives on to the next generation.<br/>
  Any dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes alive.<br/>

  **How to use**: <br/>
  Build from the source code yourself, or download the build.zip.
